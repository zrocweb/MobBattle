# Key words:
#   Wave: These are random sets of mobs generated automatically. They have a difficulty rating based on the number of players, wave number and difficulty-multiplier.
#   Difficulty: Each mob has a difficulty rating.  To generate a random wave:
#               1. A random mob is chosen
#               2. If the combined difficulty of all selected mobs is higher than the wave difficulty, go to step 1
#               2. If the mobs difficulty plus all previously chosen mobs difficulty is greater than the waves difficulty, Go to step 1 (AKA, Find an easier mob)
#               3. If the wave number is < minWave or > maxWave, Go to step 1
#               4. Spawn the mob
#               5. If the combined difficulty of all selected mobs is less than the wave difficulty rating, go to step 1.
#               6. Start wave.
